# project2-knudson_christie

## Issues?
I had several issues, but more on the complete understanding of the language needed for the project. With teacher assistance, I gain better understanding of how I was suppose to type it. Some included learning that using the class name "top" can cause issues with some javascript properties, adding more loops in the functionality, and expanding the clickable area.

## Resources?
I used a lot of help from w3schools, css tricks, MDN, and stack overflow, but no other resources.
